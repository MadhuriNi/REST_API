REST API :

1. What is REST API ? 
   REST stands for Representational state transfer. REST is an approch to or an architectural style for writing API
   
   API stands for Application Program Interface. API can return data that you need for your application in a convenient format(e.g JSON or XML)
   
   REST API defines a set of operations where developers can send a requests and can recieve a response via HTTP Protocol
   
   Most of the times we write our own REST APIs but sometimes the third party tools will itself gives the rest APIs. These given REST APIs will have access to the third party tools which our REST APIs wont have
   
   REST APIs are Stateless communication. REST APIs are independent of the language. The client and server can be in two different languages
   
   
   
                req(JSON/XML)                req(HTTPS)
   Application ----------------> REST API --------------------> 3rd party DB
               <---------------           <--------------------
                resp(JSON/XML)               resp(HTTPS)
	
   An API is REST API if it has http methods like get and post
				
				
				
2. What is exactly REST API testing ?
   We will be validating the response of REST API. Whatever the response REST API is sending is it correct or not ? The response from REST API should match with the response on the application
   
3. What is an Endpoint in REST API ?
   The address of REST API which we need to hit is called Endpoint. Endpoint contains : (BURP)
   BaseURL    : the website (www.qaclickacademy.com)
   Resource   : individual files (home,courses,videos,interview guide,practise,blog,about,contact)
   Parameters : 
   
   Endpoint : BaseURL/resource?Parameters
              www.qaclickacademy.com/courses-detail/id=130
			  
			  
4. What are the types of REST requests ?
   GET    : to retrieve something or to extract information from the server. It will have no other effect 		  on the data. Parameters are send as the part of Endpoint. No Payload/Body required
   POST   : to add something or creating something new in your backend code(server). Parameters will be in 		   JSON/XML and will be in body/payload
   PUT    : same as POST
   DELETE : Delete the data from ur server. It will be present in body/payload
   

5. What are the different types of tools of testing of REST API ?
   PostMan
   Advanced Rest Client(Addon to Chrome)
   SOAP UI
   JMETER
   
6. Google API Manual testing :

	

	goto this site on google : https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search
	
	https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=-33.8670522,151.1957362&radius=1500&type=restaurant&keyword=cruise&key=YOUR_API_KEY

	Base URL   : https://maps.googleapis.com/
	Resources  : maps/api/place/nearbysearch/
	Output     : json
	Parameters :location=-33.8670522,151.1957362  radius=1500 
	
   Google API Key : AIzaSyD82ZLTLwR9Yiwjt6ThTbJZytC-ZCZTyQA
   
   
   In Postman enter all these things, method = GET and send you will get the output
   
   
   
 For Post method, there is one customised url created   :http://216.10.245.166/maps/api/place/add/json?key=qaclick123
   
   Select Body --> raw --> JSON(application/json)
   
   {
    "location":{
        "lat" : -38.383494,
        "lng" : 33.427362
    },
    "accuracy":50,
    "name":"Frontline house",
    "phone_number":"(+91) 983 893 3937",
    "address" : "29, side layout, cohen 09",
    "types": ["shoe park","shop"],
    "website" : "http://google.com",
    "language" : "French-IN"
}
   
   
  http://216.10.245.166/maps/api/place/add/xml?key=qaclick123
  
  Select Body --> raw --> XML(application/xml)
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<root>
    <location>
        <lat>-38.383494</lat>
        <lng>33.427362</lng>
    </location>
    <accuracy>50</accuracy>
    <name>The Mens store</name>

7. REST API Automation : 
   
   Eclipse is the IDE which we will use for automation of REST API. 
   Download REST Assured jars from : rest-assured.io/
   
   
 8.  for the code in eclipse :
   
   //BURP (Base URI, Resource, Parameters)
   
   Firstly, pass the uri -> RestAssured.baseURI="https://maps.googleapis.com";
   
   in the given block, we can pass headers,cookies,parameters,body(when the req is post)
   
   given().
		param("","").
		header("","").
		cookie("","").
		body().
   
   in the when() block pass resource
   
   when().
		 get("maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json").
   
   in the then() block pass assertions 
   
   	then().
		assertThat().statusCode(200);
		
		assertThat().statusCode(200).and().contentType(ContentType.JSON);
   
   from extract(), pull out the required variables
